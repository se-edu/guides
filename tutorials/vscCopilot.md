## Using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code

### Basic Code Completion
  * In a Java file, type a comment like `// print Hello World` inside the main method.
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // print Hello World
        }
    }
    ```
  * GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest code to complete or implement the comment.<br>
    <pic src="images/vscCopilotUsage/basicCodeCompletion.png" width="400" />
  * Press `Tab` to accept the suggestion, or continue typing to refine it.
  <box type="tip" seamless>
    The more descriptive your comment or method signatures, the better Copilot can understand what you want to implement.
    </box>

### Copilot Chat

  * Open the Copilot Chat using {{ icon_windows }}/{{ icon_linux}} `Ctrl+Alt+I` | {{ icon_apple }} `Cmd+Alt+I` or using the Copilot icon.
  * Ask something like: "Write a main method that calculates the factorial of N".
  * Copilot will generate a response in the chat window.<br>
    <pic src="images/vscCopilotUsage/copilotChat.png" width="400" />
  * You can directly insert or copy code chunks using the buttons in the top right corner.

Some common project-related prompts you might find useful:

* Run the checkstyle
* Compile and run the Java program
* Run JUnit tests
* ~~Perform Git operations~~ (possible but #r#not recommended##; if you are new to Git, we discourage using Git inside the IDE -- it is better for beginners to learn Git independent of other tools)
