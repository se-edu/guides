GitHub Copilot is an AI Tool that is well-integrated with VS Code, because both tools are from the same parent company (Microsoft).

## Using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code

The Copilot extension offers multiple ways to interact with AI assistance in VS Code:

- **Copilot Chat** – for general-purpose questions or help
- **Inline Chat** – for editing or explaining specific code blocks
- **Terminal Prompts** – for quick commands like `/explain`, `/fix` from the terminal

### Basic Code Completion

**To get Copilot to complete code based on a comment**:

1. In a Java file, type a comment like `// print Hello World` inside the main method.
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // print Hello World
        }
    }
    ```
1. GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest code to complete or implement the comment.<br>
    <pic src="images/vscCopilotUsage/basicCodeCompletion.png" width="400" /><p/>
1. Press `Tab` to accept the suggestion, or continue typing to refine it.
  <box type="tip" seamless>
    The more descriptive your comment or method signatures, the better Copilot can understand what you want to implement.
  </box>

**To disable automatic code completion**,

1. Look for the Copilot icon in the bottom right of vscode:<br>
<pic src="images/vscCopilotUsage/copilotIconBottomBar.png" width="300" /><br>
1. Uncheck the necessary boxes (`All files` disables code completion for all files, while the checkbox below it disables code completion for the currently open file type.)

If you have access to Copilot Pro, you can also monitor your Copilot Premium Requests usage here.<br>

</box>


### Copilot Chat

  * Open the Copilot Chat using {{ icon_windows }}/{{ icon_linux}} `Ctrl+Alt+I` | {{ icon_apple }} `Cmd+Alt+I` or using the Copilot icon.
  * Ask something like: "Write a main method that calculates the factorial of N".
  * Copilot will generate a response in the chat window.<br>
    <pic src="images/vscCopilotUsage/copilotChat.png" width="400" />
  * You can directly insert or copy code chunks using the buttons in the top right corner.
  * From left to right: Insert automatically into the current file, Insert at cursor, Copy to clipboard.<br>
    <pic src="images/vscCopilotUsage/copilotChatButtons.png" width="100" />

  * The Copilot Chat interface also contains a variety of useful features.<br>
    <pic src="images/vscCopilotUsage/copilotChatInterface.png" width="400" />
    1. You can toggle between 3 different modes, **ask** (ask a question and copilot generates an answer), **edit** (ask copilot to edit a select number of files) and **agent** (ask copilot to execute autonomously with a high level prompt). Find out more about the different modes [here](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/copilot-ask-edit-and-agent-modes-what-they-do-and-when-to-use-them/).
    2. By default, only the currently opened file will be included in the chat context (i.e. "visible" to Copilot). Include additional context by pressing the **Add Context** button, which will open up a window at the top that allows you to select files to add to Copilot Chat's context. <br>
    <pic src="images/vscCopilotUsage/copilotChatAddContext.png" width="600" />
    3. You can choose between different AI models to use. If you have access to [Copilot Pro](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/manage-your-account/get-free-access-to-copilot-pro) (which comes with Github Education), you can select premium models.
    4. You can use mentions, by typing `@` followed by the participant's name, or clicking on the `@` icon. This allows you to invoke certain chat participants that are optimized to answer questions about their respective domains. One useful mention is `@workspace`, which answers questions about your entire repository.

### Copilot Inline Chat

  * Go to the line or section where you want to ask Copilot for assistance.
  * Use the inline chat feature using the shortcut {{ icon_windows }}/{{ icon_linux}} `Ctrl+I` | {{ icon_apple }} `Cmd+I`.
  * Type your request such as "Add a print log here" and press `Enter`.
  * The generated lines of code will be highlighted in yellow, and you can insert them by clicking on `accept`.<br>

### Prompting Copilot in the Terminal

1. Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code.
1. Press `Ctrl+I` to bring up Copilot’s terminal prompt input.<br>
    <pic src="images/vscCopilotUsage/copilotTerminal.png" width="600" />

Some common project-related prompts you might find useful:

* Run the checkstyle
* Compile and run the Java program
* Run JUnit tests
* ~~Perform Git operations~~ (possible but #r#not recommended##; if you are new to Git, we discourage using Git inside the IDE -- it is better for beginners to learn Git independent of other tools)

**Troubleshooting Tips**
- Copilot not showing up? → Ensure you are in a Java file and that the extension is installed and enabled.
- Copilot panel missing? → Try restarting VS Code or reinstalling the extension.
